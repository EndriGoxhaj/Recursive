# Fibonacci & Merge Sort in JavaScript

This repository contains recursive implementations of two essential algorithms:

1. **Recursive Fibonacci**:
   - A simple function to compute Fibonacci numbers recursively.
   - Demonstrates the basic concept of recursion in problem-solving.

2. **Recursive Merge Sort**:
   - An efficient sorting algorithm based on the divide-and-conquer technique.
   - Sorts arrays in ascending order with a time complexity of O(n log n).
